## The Pure Rust Revolution: No More C/Fortran Dependencies

### Breaking Free from Legacy Dependencies

For decades, scientific computing has been shackled to C and Fortran dependencies. NumPy, SciPy, and TensorFlow all rely on system libraries like OpenBLAS and LAPACK - creating installation nightmares, cross-platform compatibility issues, and security vulnerabilities.

**SciRS2 changes everything.**

By default, SciRS2 requires **zero external C, C++, or Fortran dependencies**:

- **BLAS/LAPACK**: Pure Rust [OxiBLAS](https://github.com/cool-japan/oxiblas) implementation (no OpenBLAS/MKL/Accelerate required)
- **FFT Operations**: Pure Rust [OxiFFT](https://github.com/cool-japan/oxifft) implementation with FFTW-comparable performance
- **Random Number Generation**: Pure Rust implementations of all statistical distributions
- **All Core Modules**: Every scientific computing module works out-of-the-box

### Installation Made Effortless

```bash
# That's it. No system libraries. No configuration. No headaches.
cargo add scirs2
```

Compare this to traditional scientific Python setup:

```bash
# Python way: System library hell
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran gcc g++ pkg-config
pip install numpy scipy
# Hope everything links correctly...
```

### The Benefits of Pure Rust

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system prevents memory leaks, buffer overflows, and data races
- **Cross-Platform**: Same code works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and WebAssembly without recompilation
- **Reproducible Builds**: No external library version conflicts or ABI compatibility issues
- **Security**: No hidden vulnerabilities in ancient C/Fortran code from the 1970s
- **Performance**: Competitive or superior performance compared to optimized C/Fortran libraries
