  - Fixed `needless_borrows_for_generic_args` warnings in scirs2-autograd tests (5 occurrences)
  - Replaced `is_some() + expect()` patterns with `if let Some()` for better idiomatic code
- **Linting Improvements**
  - Autograd optimizer code quality improvements
  - Test code clarity enhancements
  - Updated .gitignore for better project hygiene

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed assertion style in scirs2-ndimage contours: `len() >= 1` → `!is_empty()`

### Technical Details

#### Quality Metrics
- **Tests**: All 11,400+ tests passing across 170+ binaries
- **Warnings**: Zero compilation warnings, zero clippy warnings
- **Code Size**: 2.42M total lines (1.68M Rust code, 149K comments)
- **Files**: 4,730 Rust files across 23 workspace crates

#### Pure Rust Compliance
- ✅ **FFT**: 100% Pure Rust via OxiFFT (no FFTW dependency)
- ✅ **BLAS/LAPACK**: 100% Pure Rust via OxiBLAS
- ✅ **Random**: Pure Rust statistical distributions
- ✅ **Default Build**: No C/C++/Fortran dependencies required

#### Platform Support
- ✅ **Linux (x86_64)**: Full support with all features
- ✅ **macOS (ARM64/x86_64)**: Full support with Metal acceleration
- ✅ **Windows (x86_64)**: Full support with optimizations
- ✅ **WebAssembly**: Compatible (Pure Rust benefits)

### Performance Impact

The zero-allocation SIMD operations and OxiFFT migration provide:
- Reduced memory allocations in numerical computation hot paths
- Improved cache locality through in-place operations
- Better cross-platform performance consistency
- Maintained FFTW-level FFT performance in Pure Rust

### Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible with 0.1.1 API.

### Notes

This release strengthens SciRS2's Pure Rust foundation while adding production-ready ML optimization infrastructure. The FFT migration eliminates the last major C dependency in the default build, making SciRS2 truly 100% Pure Rust by default.
